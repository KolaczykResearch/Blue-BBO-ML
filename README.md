# Introduction
This is the GitHub site for the paper 'Predicting Emission Wavelengths in Benzobisoxazole based OLEDs with Extreme Gradient Boosting Ensemble Models'.

## Code
All of the codes doing modeling and analysis are uploaded in this section.

## Blue-BBO-ML
All the DFT data of the molecules is in 'Database_DFT.xlsx'. Below is the visualization of all the molecular structure.
